# Parallel and Circular Formation Control of a School of Robotic Fish
This is the companion code for the parallel and circular formation control method reported in the paper Planar Formation Control of a School of Robotic Fish by Paul Ghanem et al, ACC 2020. The paper can be found here (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9147969). The code allows the users to reproduce the results reported in the paper. Please cite the above paper when reporting, reproducing or extending the results.
## Purpose of the project
This software is a research prototype, solely developed for and published as part of the publication cited above. It will neither be maintained nor monitored in any way.
## Requirements, how to build, test, install, use, etc.
The code depends on MATLAB.
### Reproducing results
The experiments reported in the publication can be run by executing
